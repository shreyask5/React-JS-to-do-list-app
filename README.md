# To-Do List App: Task Manager  

This project, **To-Do List App**, is a React.js-based web application designed to streamline task management. With a sleek, intuitive interface and persistent data storage via local storage, it ensures users can efficiently manage their tasks. The app follows a modular structure, dividing functionalities across three components: TodoInput for adding tasks, TodoList for managing and displaying tasks, and TodoCard for editing and deleting individual tasks.  

The app dynamically updates tasks in real-time, reflecting changes instantly with React’s state management. Local storage integration ensures tasks persist even after a page refresh, enhancing usability. The use of icons from Font Awesome and responsive design ensures the app is visually appealing and accessible across devices.
